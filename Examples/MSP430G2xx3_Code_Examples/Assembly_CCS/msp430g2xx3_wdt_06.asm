;                        MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
; 
;  MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
;  demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
;  concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
;  register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
;  be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
;  effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
;  for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

;   MSP430G2xx3 Demo - WDT+ Failsafe Clock, 32kHz ACLK
;
;   Description; Allow WDT+ in watchdog to timeout sourced by ACLK. LPM3 is
;   entered, this example will demonstrate WDT+ feature by automatically
;   re-enabling WDT+ clock source as DCO if external XTAL fails. This can be
;   seen as a continued, though faster as clocked by DCO, watchdog timeout
;   which will toggle on P1.0 in main function.
;   ACLK = 32kHz, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO
