;                        MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
; 
;  MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
;  demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
;  concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
;  register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
;  be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
;  effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
;  for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

;   MSP430G2xx3 Demo - Timer_A, Toggle P1.1/TA0, Up Mode, 32kHz ACLK
;
;   Description: Toggle P1.1 using hardware TA0 output. Timer_A is configured
;   for up mode with CCR0 defining period, TA0 also output on P1.1. In this
;   example, CCR0 is loaded with 10 and TA0 will toggle P.1.1 at TACLK/10.
;   Thus the output frequency on P1.1 will be the TACLK/20. No CPU or
;   software resources required. Normal operating mode is LPM3.
;   As coded with TACLK = ACLK, P1.1 output frequency = 32768/20 = 1.6384kHz.
;   ACLK = TACLK = 32kHz, MCLK = default DCO ~800kHz
;   //* External watch crystal installed on XIN XOUT is required for ACLK *//
