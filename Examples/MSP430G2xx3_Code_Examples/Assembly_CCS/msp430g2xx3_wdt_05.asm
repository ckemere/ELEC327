;                        MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
; 
;  MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
;  demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
;  concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
;  register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
;  be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
;  effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
;  for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

;   MSP430G2xx3 Demo - Reset on Invalid Address fetch, Toggle P1.0
;
;   Description: Toggle P1.0 by xor'ing P1.0 inside of a software loop that
;   ends with TAR loaded with 3FFFh - op-code for "jmp $" This simulates a code
;   error. The MSP430F2xx will force a reset because it will not allow a fetch
;   from within the address range of the peripheral memory, as is seen by
;   return to the mainloop and LED flash.
;   In contrast, an MSP430F1xx device will "jmp $" stopping code execution with
;   no LED flash.
;   ACLK = n/a, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO
