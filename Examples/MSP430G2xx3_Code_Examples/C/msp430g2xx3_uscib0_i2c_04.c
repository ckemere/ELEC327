 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side

//  MSP430G2xx3 Demo - USCI_B0 I2C Master RX single bytes from MSP430 Slave
//
//  Description: This demo connects two MSP430's via the I2C bus. The master
//  reads from the slave. This is the master code. The data from the slave
//  transmitter begins at 0 and increments with each transfer. The received
//  data is in R5 and is checked for validity. If the received data is
//  incorrect, the CPU is trapped and the P1.0 LED will stay on. The USCI_B0
//  RX interrupt is used to know when new data has been received.
//  ACLK = n/a, MCLK = SMCLK = BRCLK = default DCO = ~1.2MHz
//
//  *** to be used with "msp430g2xx3_uscib0_i2c_05.c" ***
