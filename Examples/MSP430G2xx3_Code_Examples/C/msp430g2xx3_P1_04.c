 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP430G2xx3 Demo - P1 Interrupt from LPM4 with Internal Pull-up
//
//  Description: A hi/low transition on P1.4 will trigger P1_ISR which,
//  toggles P1.0. Normal mode is LPM4 ~ 0.1uA.
//  Internal pullup enabled on P1.4.
//  ACLK = n/a, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO
