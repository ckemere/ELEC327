 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware

//  MSP430G2xx3 Demo - Timer_A, PWM TA1-2, Up Mode, DCO SMCLK
//
//  Description: This program generates one PWM output on P1.2 using
//  Timer_A configured for up mode. The value in CCR0, 512-1, defines the PWM
//  period and the value in CCR1 the PWM duty cycles.
//  A 75% duty cycle on P1.2.
//  ACLK = na, SMCLK = MCLK = TACLK = default DCO
