 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware

//   MSP430G2x13/G2x53 Demo - Comp_A, Detect Threshold, Set P1.0 if P1.1 > 0.25*Vcc
//
//   Description: Use Comparator_A to detect a voltage threshold.
//   Using an external potentiometer, an unknown voltage is applied to P1.1.
//   Comparator_A compares the unknown voltage to an internal reference
//   voltage, in this example 0.25*VCC. If the unknown voltage is higher
//   than 0.25*VCC, P1.0 is set, if not, P1.0 is reset.
//   ACLK = n/a, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO
