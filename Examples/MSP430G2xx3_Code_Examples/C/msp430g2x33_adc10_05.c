 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly

 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side

//  MSP430G2x33/G2x53 Demo - ADC10, Sample A11, Lo_Batt, Set P1.0 if < 2.3V
//
//  Description: A single sample is made on A11 (AVcc/2) with reference to
//  internal 1.5V Vref. Software sets ADC10SC to start sample and conversion
//  - ADC10SC automatically cleared at EOC. ADC10 internal oscillator times
//  sample (16x) and conversion. ADC10BUSY flag is polled for EOC. If A11
//  (AVcc/2) < 0311h (0.65V) indicating AVcc is less 2.3V, P1.0 set indicating
//  a lo_Batt condition, else reset.
