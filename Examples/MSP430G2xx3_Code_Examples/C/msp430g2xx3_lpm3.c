 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware

//  MSP430G2xx3 Demo - Basic Clock, LPM3 Using WDT ISR, 32kHz ACLK
//
//  Description: This program operates MSP430 normally in LPM3, pulsing P1.0
//  at 4 second intervals. WDT ISR used to wake-up system. All I/O configured
//  as low outputs to eliminate floating inputs. Current consumption does
//  increase when LED is powered on P1.0. Demo for measuring LPM3 current.
//  ACLK = LFXT1/4 = 32768/4, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO ~ 800kHz
//  //* External watch crystal installed on XIN XOUT is required for ACLK *//
