 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP430G2xx3 Demo - USCI_B0 I2C Slave RX single bytes from MSP430 Master
//
//  Description: This demo connects two MSP430's via the I2C bus. The master
//  transmits to the slave. This is the slave code. The interrupt driven
//  data receiption is demonstrated using the USCI_B0 RX interrupt.
//  ACLK = n/a, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO = ~1.2MHz
//
//  *** to be used with "msp430g2xx3_uscib0_i2c_06.c" ***
