//  MSP430G2xx3 Demo - WDT, Toggle P1.0, Interval Overflow ISR, 32kHz ACLK
//
//  Description: Toggle P1.0 using software timed by WDT ISR. Toggle rate is
//  exactly 250ms based on 32kHz ACLK WDT clock source.  In this example the
//  WDT is configured to divide 32768 watch-crystal(2^15) by 2^13 with an ISR
//  triggered @ 4Hz.
//  ACLK = LFXT1 = 32768Hz, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO
//  //* External watch crystal installed on XIN XOUT is required for ACLK *//
