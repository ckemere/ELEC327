 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//   MSP430G2xx3 Demo - USCI_A0, SPI 3-Wire Slave Data Echo
//
//   Description: SPI slave talks to SPI master using 3-wire mode. Data received
//   from master is echoed back.  USCI RX ISR is used to handle communication,
//   CPU normally in LPM4.  Prior to initial data exchange, master pulses
//   slaves RST for complete reset.
//   ACLK = n/a, MCLK = SMCLK = DCO ~1.2MHz
//
//   Use with SPI Master Incremented Data code example.  If the slave is in
//   debug mode, the reset signal from the master will conflict with slave's
//   JTAG; to work around, use IAR's "Release JTAG on Go" on slave device.  If
//   breakpoints are set in slave RX ISR, master must stopped also to avoid
//   overrunning slave RXBUF.
