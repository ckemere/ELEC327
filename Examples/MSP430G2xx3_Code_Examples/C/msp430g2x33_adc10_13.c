//  MSP430G2x33/G2x53 Demo - ADC10, DTC Sample A1 32x, AVcc, TA0 Trig, DCO
//
//  Description; A1 is sampled in 32x burst using DTC 16 times per second
//  (ACLK/2048) with reference to AVcc. Activity is interrupt driven.
//  Timer_A in upmode uses TA0 toggle to drive ADC10 conversion. Sample burst
//  is automatically triggered by TA0 rising edge every 2048 ACLK cycles.
//  ADC10_ISR will exit from LPM3 mode and return CPU active. Internal ADC10OSC
//  times sample (16x) and conversion (13x). DTC transfers conversion code to
//  RAM 200h - 240h. In the Mainloop P1.0 is toggled. Normal Mode is LPM3.
//  //* An external watch crystal on XIN XOUT is required for ACLK *//
//
