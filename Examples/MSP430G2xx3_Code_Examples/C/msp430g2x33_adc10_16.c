 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side

//  MSP430G2x33/G2x53 Demo - ADC10, DTC Sample A0 -> TA1, AVcc, DCO
//
//  Description: Use DTC to sample A0 with reference to AVcc and directly
//  transfer code to TACCR1. Timer_A has been configured for 10-bit PWM mode.
//  TACCR1 duty cycle is automatically proportional to ADC10 A0. WDT_ISR used
//  as a period wakeup timer approximately 45ms based on default ~1.2MHz
//  DCO/SMCLK clock source used in this example for the WDT clock source.
//  Timer_A also uses default DCO.
