 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side

//  MSP430G2x33/G2x53 Demo - ADC10, DTC Sample A2-0, AVcc, Single Sequence, DCO
//
//  Description: Sample A3/A2/A1 as single sequence with reference to AVcc.
//  Software sets ADC10SC to trigger sample sequence. In Mainloop MSP430 waits
//  in LPM0 to save power until ADC10 conversion complete, ADC10_ISR(DTC) will
//  force exit from any LPMx in Mainloop on reti. ADC10_ISR will force any LPMx
//  exit. ADC10 internal oscillator times sample period (16x) and conversion
//  (13x). DTC transfers conversion code to RAM 200h - 206h. P1.0 set at start
//  of conversion burst, reset on completion.
