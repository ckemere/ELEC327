 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly

 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side

//  MSP430G2x33/G2x53 Demo - ADC10, Sample A1, AVcc Ref, Set P1.0 if > 0.5*AVcc
//
//  Description: A single sample is made on A1 with reference to AVcc.
//  Software sets ADC10SC to start sample and conversion - ADC10SC
//  automatically cleared at EOC. ADC10 internal oscillator times sample (16x)
//  and conversion. In Mainloop MSP430 waits in LPM0 to save power until ADC10
//  conversion complete, ADC10_ISR will force exit from LPM0 in Mainloop on
//  reti. If A1 > 0.5*AVcc, P1.0 set, else reset.
